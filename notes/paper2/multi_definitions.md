# Multi-Ring Model — Definitions and Conjectures (Paper 2)

Companion to `../paper1/chiral_ring_spec.md` and `../paper1/backward_process.md`
(Paper 1). Paper 1 is the foundation and is **not modified**. All Paper-2 code
lives in `src/multi/`.

Status: definitions fixed before coding (work-order step 1). Conjectures C1–C5
are stated here as targets; verdicts live in `results_multi.md`.

**Terminology (interpretation-agnostic).** "Branch" = a component of the
einselected decomposition of the joint ring state; the chirality tuple
`S = (s_1,…,s_M)` labels it. Any *branch-relative* quantity is a conditional
expectation in the ordinary Bayesian sense (condition on the classical branch
variable, which is conserved). No Everettian commitment is made or needed; an
observer-internal reading (a record-holder conditions on the facts they hold) is
sufficient and is the one used in Paper 1, §5.

---

## 1. Setup

- `M` chiral rings (principal case `M = 2`), each a Paper-1 3-site ring. Ring `i`
  carries a conserved chirality `s_i = ±1` (eigenvalue of its current operator
  `Î_i`, values `±I₀`, `I₀ = √3 J`). Because `[H_S, Î_i] = 0` for every ring,
  the joint tuple `S = (s_1,…,s_M) ∈ {±1}^M` is a fixed classical branch
  variable, drawn once at `t = 0` with uniform prior `P(S) = 2^{-M}`.
- Bath: `N` qubits, coupling matrix `g_{i,n} ≥ 0` (`i` ring, `n` qubit). Default
  bath state `|+x⟩^{⊗N}`.
- Conditional on `S`, qubit `n` sees a pure-dephasing rotation
  `U_n(S,t) = e^{-i a_n(S) t σ_z}`, with the **branch phase rate**

      a_n(S) = Σ_i s_i g_{i,n}.                                        (1)

  Its conditional state is `|φ_n(S,t)⟩ = e^{-i a_n(S) t σ_z}|+x⟩`.

Everything below is a *closed form* derived from `|φ_n(S,t)⟩`. Only posterior
*sampling* (drawing records ξ and forming Bayes posteriors) is Monte-Carlo. If a
quantity seems to require simulating dynamics, the branch structure has been
missed (work-order guard-rail).

## 2. Coherences — the object Γ

Single-qubit overlap between two branches:

    ⟨φ_n(S',t)|φ_n(S,t)⟩ = ⟨+x| e^{-i (a_n(S)-a_n(S')) t σ_z} |+x⟩
                          = cos( (a_n(S) − a_n(S')) t )  ≡ c_n(S,S';t).  (2)

Real, so all branch coherences are real. The joint reduced ring state in the
chiral basis is

    ρ_joint(t) = (1/2^M) Σ_{S,S'} Γ_{S,S'}(t) |S⟩⟨S'|,
    Γ_{S,S'}(t) = Π_n c_n(S,S';t),    Γ_{S,S} = 1.                      (3)

`ρ_joint` is a `2^M × 2^M` matrix; off-diagonal `(S,S')` block equals
`Γ_{S,S'}/2^M`. (This is a *reduced* ring–ring object; the global ring+bath state
stays pure under the unmonitored dynamics.)

**Decoherence-free subspace (DFS).** `Γ_{S,S'}(t) = 1 ∀t` iff
`c_n(S,S';t)=1 ∀n,t` iff `a_n(S) = a_n(S') ∀n`, i.e.

    Σ_i (s_i − s'_i) g_{i,n} = 0   for every qubit n.                   (4)

When all rings share **identical couplings** `g_{i,n} = g_n` (∀i), then
`a_n(S) = g_n Σ_i s_i` depends only on the total chirality `Σ_i s_i`. Any two
branches with the same total chirality are mutually decoherence-free. For `M = 2`
the pair `(+,−)` and `(−,+)` both have total chirality `0`: the coherence
`Γ_{(+,−),(−,+)}(t) = 1 ∀t` (protected), while `Γ_{(+,+),(−,−)}` decays maximally.
This is the analytic content behind conjecture **C1**.

## 3. Records — collision readout and distinguishability

Collision protocol (as in `backward_process.md` §2): qubit `n` interacts for a
window and is measured in `σ_y`, outcome `r_n = ±1`. The `σ_y` expectation in
`|φ_n(S,t)⟩` is

    μ_n(S,t) = ⟨φ_n(S,t)| σ_y |φ_n(S,t)⟩ = sin( 2 a_n(S) t ),          (5)

so the record likelihood is

    P(r_n | S) = (1 + r_n μ_n(S,t)) / 2.                                (6)

(For a dedicated collision window Δt the argument is `2 a_n(S) Δt`; we treat the
readout time `t` as the interaction time, the snapshot convention of Paper-1
`exact.py`. Both are the same one-parameter family.)

Global sign flip `−S = (−s_1,…,−s_M)` gives `a_n(−S) = −a_n(S)`, hence
`μ_n(−S) = −μ_n(S)`: the antipodal branch is the perfectly time-reversed record
source, exactly as in Paper 1 (there `M=1`, `−S = −s`).

**Branch-relative stochastic entropy production** (Paper 1, Eq. 6, lifted to the
joint antipode):

    σ_S[ξ] = Σ_n ln [ P(r_n|S) / P(r_n|−S) ]
           = Σ_n ln [ (1 + r_n μ_n(S)) / (1 − r_n μ_n(S)) ].           (7)

Mean over forward trajectories in branch `S`:

    ⟨σ_S⟩ = Σ_n μ_n(S) ln[(1+μ_n(S))/(1−μ_n(S))]
          = Σ_n D_KL( P(·|S) ‖ P(·|−S) ) ≡ D(S,t) ≥ 0.                 (8)

Define per-qubit quality `ε_n(S) = |μ_n(S)| = |sin(2 a_n(S) t)|`, so
`D(S,t) = Σ_n ε_n ln((1+ε_n)/(1−ε_n))`. For `M=1` this reduces to Paper-1
`record_distinguishability` verbatim.

## 4. Posterior, polarization, marginal arrows

Given a record `ξ = (r_1,…,r_N)`, the Bayes posterior over the `2^M` branches is

    P(S | ξ) ∝ P(S) Π_n (1 + r_n μ_n(S)) = 2^{-M} Π_n (1 + r_n μ_n(S)).  (9)

Per-ring branch estimate and polarization (Paper-1 `P = E|2q−1|` lifted):

    m_i(ξ) = E[s_i | ξ] = Σ_S s_i P(S|ξ),   P_i(t) = E_ξ | m_i(ξ) |.    (10)

Ring–ring record correlation (used in scenario c):

    χ_12(ξ) = E[s_1 s_2 | ξ] = Σ_S s_1 s_2 P(S|ξ),  E_ξ[χ_12].          (11)

### 4.1 Marginal entropy production σ_i  (the C2 subtlety)

`σ_S` in (7) is a *joint* arrow: it uses the full branch `S` and its global
antipode `−S`. A per-ring arrow `σ_i` must compare `s_i = +1` against `s_i = −1`
while the other chiralities are *unknown to ring i's record channel*. There is a
genuine modelling choice here; we state the options and fix one.

- **Option A — marginal-likelihood ratio (CHOSEN).** Marginalise the other
  chiralities out of the likelihood with the uniform prior:

      L_i^{±}(ξ) = Σ_{s_{-i}} 2^{-(M-1)} Π_n (1 + r_n μ_n(s_i=±1, s_{-i})),
      σ_i[ξ] = ln [ L_i^{+}(ξ) / L_i^{-}(ξ) ] · sign convention below.  (12)

  To make `σ_i` branch-relative (an arrow *for the branch actually realised*,
  matching (7)), we evaluate it in branch `S` and orient it by `s_i`:

      σ_i^{(S)}[ξ] = s_i · ln [ L_i^{+}(ξ) / L_i^{-}(ξ) ].               (13)

  For `M=1`, `L_i^{±}` has no sum and (13) collapses to (7): consistent.

- **Option B — plug-in / conditional.** Condition on the *true* other
  chiralities and flip only `s_i`:
  `σ_i^{plug}[ξ|S] = Σ_n ln[P(r_n|S)/P(r_n|S^{(i)})]`, `S^{(i)} =` S with `s_i`
  flipped. This is clean but **not** additive-decomposable against a shared bath
  in the way C2 needs: `Σ_i σ_i^{plug}` double-counts qubits coupled to several
  rings through the joint antipode, and its deficit against `σ_S` has no clean
  information-theoretic name.

**Choice and justification.** We adopt Option A/(13). Rationale: (i) it reduces
to Paper 1 at `M=1`; (ii) each `σ_i` is then the log-likelihood-ratio of an
*observable* marginal (the record's information about `s_i` alone, integrating
out what it cannot resolve), so `⟨σ_i⟩ = ` the marginal KL distinguishability
`D_i`, the natural per-ring analogue of (8); (iii) the deficit below acquires a
clean name. Option B is recorded here and in a code comment as the alternative;
we do not pursue it (C2 stop-loss: one session).

### 4.2 The additivity deficit (C2)

    Δ(t) ≡ ⟨σ_S⟩ − Σ_i ⟨σ_i⟩ = D(S,t) − Σ_i D_i(t).                   (14)

With disjoint baths (no qubit couples to two rings) the joint likelihood
factorises over rings, the marginals are exact, and `Δ = 0` (scenario a — an
*exactness test*, not a result). With a shared bath, qubits carry joint
information about several chiralities; the marginal channels lose the
cross-ring part. **Conjecture C2:** `Δ(t) ≥ 0`, and equals the *multi-information*
(total correlation) that the record ensemble carries among the rings,

    Δ(t) =? I_multi[records] = Σ_i H(σ_i-channel) − H(joint σ-channel),  (15)

estimated on the sampled trajectories (symmetric binning). C2's job is to test
(15) numerically and report the residual; the sign `Δ ≥ 0` is the firm part.

## 5. Mirror preparation (backward boundary condition)

Following `backward_process.md`: a *mirror* bath for ring `i` is prepared in the
Θ-conjugate of the **final** state of a forward evolution of duration `T`. In
closed form the per-qubit record quality **decreases**:

    ε_n^{mir}(t) = | sin( 2 a_n(S) (T − t) ) |,   t ∈ [0,T].            (16)

At `t=0` the mirror bath is "fully charged" (`ε_n = |sin(2 a_n(S) T)|`); as `t`
grows the records are **consumed**, `ε_n → 0` at `t=T`. Operationally: draw
records from the *backward* law `P_bwd(r_n|S) = (1 − r_n ε_n^{mir})/2` (Paper 1,
Eq. 3) while still scoring σ with the forward law (7). Then

    ⟨σ_i^{mir}⟩(t) = − Σ_n ε_n^{mir}(t) ln[(1+ε_n^{mir})/(1−ε_n^{mir})]
                   = − D_i^{mir}(t) ≤ 0.                                (17)

So a mirror ring runs its arrow **backwards**: entropy is destroyed, records
consumed. This is a legitimate boundary condition, not a dynamical law change;
the resulting global initial state is ring–bath **entangled** and is documented
as such (it is the Θ-image of a forward-evolved, hence entangled, state). Test
(c) of the model module checks (17) at `f=0` to sampling precision.

## 6. Inter-ring entangled initial state (for C3)

Optional ring-pair initial state (instead of the product of on-ring
superpositions):

    |Ψ_rings(0)⟩ = ( |+−⟩ + |−+⟩ ) / √2   (chiral basis, M=2).          (18)

This lives entirely in the zero-total-chirality sector `{(+,−),(−,+)}`. Its
`4×4` joint coherence matrix is read off from Γ (3): the only dynamical
off-diagonal is `Γ_{(+,−),(−,+)}(t)`. The **concurrence** of the reduced
two-ring state `ρ_12(t)` is, for this X-form state, the closed form

    C(t) = |Γ_{(+,−),(−,+)}(t)|    (normalised as below),               (19)

i.e. concurrence is *literally the protected coherence*. Define the **relative
distinguishability** of the two occupied branches,

    D_rel(t) = Σ_n |sin( (a_n(+,−) − a_n(−,+)) t )| · ln[(1+·)/(1−·)]
             = record distinguishability of (+,−) vs (−,+),            (20)

which controls how fast a bath could tell the two branches apart. **Conjecture
C3:** `C(t)` is a monotone decreasing function of `D_rel(t)` — entanglement
decays exactly as records distinguishing the two branches form — and in the DFS
(identical couplings, where `a_n(+,−) = a_n(−,+)`, so `D_rel ≡ 0`) the
concurrence is protected: `C(t) = 1 ∀t`. Slogan: *entanglement survives exactly
where no records form.*

## 6bis. Shared-qubit prescriptions (C5 robustness)

*Added before coding the consolidation run (prescriptions F/M/H); the C5
frustration scenario needs a stated preparation for the SHARED qubits, and the
threshold f* may depend on it. Exclusive qubits keep their §5 preparation
throughout: ring-1-private fresh, ring-2-private mirror-charged for duration T.*

**Unified net-phase form.** Consider a qubit forward-charged for a duration
`T_c` at its full conditional rate `a_n(S)` (the charging run is the joint
forward evolution; conditional on `S` the qubit accumulates phase `a_n(S) T_c`),
then Θ-conjugated (entangled boundary condition, exactly as §5), then re-evolved
forward for time `t`. Θ-conjugation flips the accumulated phase; the physical
record bias is therefore

    β_n(S,t) = sin( 2 a_n(S) (t − T_c) ),      T_c = 0 for a fresh qubit.  (21)

**Scoring convention (the T-trap).** `σ` compares against the FORWARD-protocol
reference (Paper 1 Eq. 5). Per `backward_process.md` §3, the record labels are
kept and the trajectory conjugation is carried by the draw law — not by
relabeling the apparatus. Operationally, per qubit:

    fresh  (T_c = 0):  μ_n(S,t) = sin(2 a_n(S) t),        draw P(r) = (1+rμ)/2
    charged (T_c > 0): μ_n(S,t) = sin(2 a_n(S) (T_c − t)), draw P(r) = (1−rμ)/2

Both cases have physical bias (21); both are scored with the forward likelihood
`(1+rμ)/2` in σ and in the posterior. Per-qubit contributions to ⟨σ⟩ are then
`±ε_n ln[(1+ε_n)/(1−ε_n)]` with `ε_n = |μ_n|`: `+` accumulating (fresh), `−`
consuming (charged). The `f=0` limits reproduce §5/§8 exactly (`⟨σ⟩ = ±D`).
`T` here is always the CHARGE DURATION; the mirror quality argument is
`T_c − t` (decreasing), matching `ε_n^mir(t) = |sin(2 g_n (T−t))|` of Eq. (16).

**The three prescriptions for shared qubits** (`a_n(S) = s_1 g_{1,n} + s_2 g_{2,n}`):

- **F — fresh (reference, existing):** `T_c = 0`.
  `ε_n^F(t) = |sin(2 a_n(S) t)|`, accumulating.
- **M — mirror-charged:** `T_c = T` (same construction as the ring-2 mirror
  bath, but the charge is written at the combined rate).
  `ε_n^M(t) = |sin(2 a_n(S) (T − t))|`, consuming on `t ∈ [0, T]`.
- **H — half-charged:** `T_c = T/2`.
  `ε_n^H(t) = |sin(2 a_n(S) (T/2 − t))|`, consuming for `t < T/2` only; at
  `t ≥ T/2` the half-charge is exhausted and the qubit physically
  re-accumulates while the convention keeps the backward reference. The
  robustness figure is evaluated at `t = 0.5 < T/2 = 0.75`, strictly inside
  the consuming regime.

Under M, at `f = 1` every qubit is charged: BOTH rings consume — the natural
expectation is that the forward ring's arrow can flip under M (the preparation
of the shared witnesses decides which arrow wins). No prediction is privileged;
the run decides.

## 6ter. Deficit decomposition theorem

*Added at consolidation (final task B). Verified independently by
`src/multi/verify_multi.py` (from-scratch enumeration, no import of
`model_multi`).*

**Setting.** `S = (s_1,…,s_M)` uniform on `{±1}^M` (independent fair prior).
Records `ξ ∈ Ξ` with conditional law `P(ξ|S)`. Marginal-channel likelihoods
`P(ξ|s_i) = 2^{-(M-1)} Σ_{s_{-i}} P(ξ|S)` and mixture `P(ξ) = 2^{-M} Σ_S P(ξ|S)`.
Arrows as in §3–4: `σ_S[ξ] = ln[P(ξ|S)/P(ξ|−S)]`,
`σ_i[ξ] = s_i ln[P(ξ|s_i=+1)/P(ξ|s_i=−1)]` (Option A), and the deficit
`Δ = ⟨σ_S⟩ − Σ_i ⟨σ_i⟩` with `⟨·⟩ = E_S E_{ξ∼P(·|S)}`.

**Hypotheses.**
- (H1) uniform independent prior on `S`;
- (H2) *antipodal flip symmetry*: there is an involution `ξ ↦ ξ̄` of the record
  space with `P(ξ̄|S) = P(ξ|−S)` for every `S`.

For the collision model, `ξ̄ = −ξ` (flip every record) satisfies (H2) for ANY
of the preparations used in this note (fresh, mirror, prescriptions F/M/H):
every per-qubit bias is odd in `S` (`μ_n(−S) = −μ_n(S)`, since all accumulated
phases are linear in `S`), so `p_n(r|−S) = (1−rμ_n(S))/2 = p_n(−r|S)`.
Conditional independence of the records is NOT required. (H1)+(H2) imply
`P(ξ̄|s_i) = P(ξ|−s_i)` (sum the flip identity over `s_{-i}`, reindex
`s_{-i} → −s_{-i}`) and `P(ξ̄) = P(ξ)`.

**Theorem (deficit decomposition).** Under (H1)–(H2),

    Δ = TC(s_1;…;s_M | ξ) + C_bwd,                                     (22)

with the (non-negative, bounded) posterior total correlation

    TC(s_1;…;s_M|ξ) = E_ξ [ Σ_i H(s_i|ξ) − H(S|ξ) ]
                    = I(ξ;S) − Σ_i I(ξ;s_i)   ∈ [0, (M−1) ln 2],       (23)

and the backward cross co-information — the exact expression, nothing hidden:

    C_bwd = − 2^{−M} Σ_S Σ_ξ P(ξ|−S) · J(ξ,S),
    J(ξ,S) ≡ ln [ P(ξ|S) P(ξ)^{M−1} / Π_i P(ξ|s_i) ].                  (24)

`J` is the pointwise co-information score of the record with the M
chiralities; `C_bwd` evaluates it on the TRUE branch `S` but averages over
records drawn from the ANTIPODAL branch `−S`. It is a cross-entropy-type
functional, extensive in general, with no bounded Shannon reading.

**Derivation.**
1. *Pointwise identity.* Adding and subtracting `(M−1) ln P(ξ)` (which cancels
   between the two brackets):

       σ_S[ξ] − Σ_i σ_i[ξ]
         = [ln P(ξ|S) − Σ_i ln P(ξ|s_i)] − [ln P(ξ|−S) − Σ_i ln P(ξ|−s_i)]
         = J(ξ,S) − J(ξ,−S).                                           (25)

   (In `σ_i`, `s_i ln[L_i^+/L_i^-] = ln P(ξ|s_i) − ln P(ξ|−s_i)` evaluated at
   the true `s_i`.)
2. *Forward average of the first term.* `E_S E_{ξ|S} J(ξ,S)
   = E ln[P(ξ|S)/P(ξ)] − Σ_i E ln[P(ξ|s_i)/P(ξ)] = I(ξ;S) − Σ_i I(ξ;s_i)`,
   and with the independent prior `I(ξ;S) − Σ_i I(ξ;s_i)
   = Σ_i H(s_i|ξ)-sum minus `H(S|ξ)` in expectation, i.e. (23).
3. *Backward form of the second term.* By (H2) applied factor by factor,
   `J(ξ,−S) = J(ξ̄,S)`. Changing variables `ξ → ξ̄` in the sum
   (`Σ_ξ P(ξ|S) J(ξ̄,S) = Σ_η P(η̄|S) J(η,S) = Σ_η P(η|−S) J(η,S)`):

       E_S E_{ξ∼P(·|S)} J(ξ,−S) = E_S E_{ξ∼P(·|−S)} J(ξ,S) = −C_bwd.   (26)

4. Subtract: `Δ = (23) + C_bwd`. ∎

For `M = 2`, `TC(s_1;s_2|ξ) = E_ξ I(s_1;s_2|ξ) ≤ ln 2` — the record-induced
multi-information of the ring pair, i.e. the object conjecture C2 pointed at.

**Exact linearization lemma (M=2 collision biases).** For `s_i = ±1`,

    sin(2 a_n(S) t) = s_1 ũ_n + s_2 ṽ_n   EXACTLY, with
    ũ_n = sin(2 g_{1,n} t) cos(2 g_{2,n} t),
    ṽ_n = cos(2 g_{1,n} t) sin(2 g_{2,n} t)                            (27)

(direct angle-addition with `s_i² = 1`; no `s_1 s_2` term arises). All M=2
record biases are exactly linear in the branch variables.

**Small-t theorem (leading order; proven symbolically for N = 1, 2 —
`verify_multi.py` check (ii) — generic couplings, and confirmed numerically at
N = 10 to the expected O(t²) accuracy).** Writing (27) and expanding in the
joint scale `λ` (`ũ, ṽ → λũ, λṽ`), both sides are controlled by ONE collective
invariant, the record-channel overlap `w ≡ Σ_n ũ_n ṽ_n`:

    Δ        = 4 w² λ⁴ + O(λ⁶),
    TC(·|ξ)  = (1/2) w² λ⁴ + O(λ⁶),
    ⇒  TC/Δ  = 1/8  exactly at leading order, ANY couplings.            (28)

(The λ² coefficients of both quantities vanish identically.) Consequences:
- the universal `0.1249` observed numerically at small t across seeds and
  shared fractions is the exact constant `1/8`;
- at small t the deficit is *collective-quadratic* — `Δ ∝ (Σ_n ũ_nṽ_n)²` is
  the square of a single sum, so it scales like N² (all-shared, same-sign
  couplings) and is NOT per-record additive. This coexists with the observed
  linear-extensive scaling `Δ ≈ 0.688·N` at t = 1.0 (results, task T3): the
  deficit crosses over from collective-quadratic (weak records) to
  extensive-linear (strong records). Consistent with the exact failure of the
  per-record decomposition (T3, check C).

**Sign of C_bwd (status: numerically supported conjecture, no proof).**
`verify_multi.py` check (iii): exhaustive N=1 grid over all flip-symmetric
product laws (min `C_bwd = −4·10⁻¹⁶`, i.e. 0 at machine precision, attained on
the boundary) and 6000 random product laws at N ∈ {2,3,4} (min `+1.6·10⁻⁸`):
no violation. Since `TC ≥ 0` always, `C_bwd ≥ 0` would imply `Δ ≥ 0`
unconditionally on this family.

## 7. The five conjectures (targets)

- **C1 — DFS objectivity.** Identical couplings ⟹ the `(+,−)↔(−,+)` coherences
  survive (Γ = 1) while `(+,+)↔(−,−)` decays; the **total** current
  objectifies (redundant records of `Σ_i s_i`), the **individual** chiralities
  never do. Test: `Γ` curves + per-ring `P_i` staying low while total-current
  polarization saturates.

- **C2 — additivity deficit.** `Δ(t) = ⟨σ_S⟩ − Σ_i⟨σ_i⟩ ≥ 0`, conjectured equal
  to the record multi-information (15). Marginal `σ_i` via Option A/(13).
  STOP-LOSS: one session on the formalisation; then measure and report the
  residual as-is.

- **C3 — entanglement lives off the records.** For initial state (18),
  `C(t) = |Γ_{(+,−),(−,+)}(t)|` is a decreasing function of `D_rel(t)`, and
  survives indefinitely in the DFS. "Entanglement survives exactly where no
  records form."

- **C4 — detailed fluctuation theorem.** At trajectory level
  `p(σ)/p(−σ) = e^{σ}`; `σ<0` trajectories exist with exponential suppression.
  Test: symmetric-bin histogram of `σ_S[ξ]` at three times; slope-1 check of
  `ln[p(σ)/p(−σ)]`; fraction of `σ<0` vs `D`. (Integral form `⟨e^{−σ}⟩=1` is the
  Paper-1 sanity check.)

- **C5 — arrow frustration (open question).** Ring 1 on a fresh forward bath,
  ring 2 on a mirror bath (records to consume), sharing a fraction `f` of qubits.
  Shared qubits cannot simultaneously accumulate and consume distinguishability.
  Competing hypotheses, none privileged: (a) the majority arrow wins;
  (b) both `σ_i` attenuate symmetrically; (c) an `f`-dependent mixed regime. **No
  firm prediction** — the observed regime, described without forcing an
  interpretation, is the result.

## 8. Reproduction and consistency anchors (must hold by construction)

- `M=1`: (2)→`∏cos(2gt)`, (5)→`sin(2gt)`, (6)/(7)/(8) → `exact.py`
  quantities verbatim (machine precision). [model test a]
- DFS (identical couplings): `Γ_{(+,−),(−,+)} ≡ 1`, `D_rel ≡ 0`, `C ≡ 1`.
  [model test b]
- Mirror at `f=0`: `⟨σ_i^{mir}⟩(t) = −D_i^{mir}(t)` (17). [model test c]
- Disjoint baths: `Δ ≡ 0` (14). [scenario a, exactness]
